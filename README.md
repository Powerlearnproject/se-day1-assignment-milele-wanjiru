Weaknesses:
Lack of flexibility to adapt to changing requirements.   
Testing occurs late in the process, potentially leading to costly rework.   
Limited user involvement during development.
Appropriate Scenarios:
Projects with fixed requirements and minimal expected changes (e.g., developing a safety-critical system for an airplane).   
Large-scale projects with strict regulatory requirements.
Projects where clear documentation is essential.
Agile Methodology:

Description:
An iterative and incremental approach that emphasizes flexibility and collaboration.   
Breaks down projects into smaller, manageable iterations (sprints).   
Focus on delivering working software frequently and adapting to feedback.   
Values customer collaboration and responding to change.   
Strengths:
Highly adaptable to changing requirements.
Frequent feedback and user involvement.
Faster delivery of working software.
Improved collaboration and communication.
Weaknesses:
Can be challenging to manage large, complex projects.
Requires strong collaboration and communication.

Project scope can drift.
Appropriate Scenarios:
Projects with rapidly changing requirements (e.g., developing a web application or mobile app).   
Projects where user feedback is crucial.
Projects where speed and flexibility are essential.
Projects where the end product is not fully known at the start.


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.Software Developer: Builds the software (coding, debugging).
QA Engineer: Tests the software (finds bugs, ensures quality).
Project Manager: Plans and manages the project (timelines, resources, communication).


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
Importance:
They centralize development tools (code editor, debugger, compiler) into a single, user-friendly interface.   
They automate repetitive tasks, provide intelligent code completion, and offer real-time error detection, accelerating development.   
They streamline debugging, making it easier to pinpoint and fix issues.   
Examples:
VS Code   
IntelliJ IDEA   
Eclipse   
Visual Studio   
Xcode   
Version Control Systems (VCS):

Importance:
They track every change made to the codebase, enabling developers to revert to previous versions and understand code evolution.   
They facilitate collaborative development by managing concurrent changes and preventing conflicts.   
They provide a reliable backup and recovery mechanism, safeguarding code from accidental loss.   
Examples:
Git (with platforms like GitHub, GitLab, and Bitbucket)   
SVN (Apache Subversion)   
Mercurial
